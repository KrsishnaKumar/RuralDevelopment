Abstract:
<br>
<p>
We need is a dedicated policy push to create alternate avenues of
employment and work in rural areas. This calls for major skill development
programs in rural areas which can push a section of the population towards non-
farm activities and reduce overcrowding of the agriculture sector. Alternative
income avenues to create jobs outside agriculture in rural areas include a policy
push to help develop the retail sector, improve education, boost rural
entrepreneurship, develop tourism, cottage and handicraft industries, horticulture,
fisheries and create better connectivity with urban centre and infrastructure The
key to rural economic development is to figure out which businesses can be
supported by your population and labor force, and which components of the
historic farming, logging, or mining economic base are still viable. Then just like
all local economies, rural economies have to take responsibility for themselves,
promote creative new businesses that can sell to customers from outside the
community, and diversify to reduce risk from too much concentration in one
particular product. </p><p>The era of a truly global economy makes everything much less
predictable, and your communities have to be ready for macro economic trends
over which they have no control. Most farm families in the United States have
already taken action to increase their income and its predictability through the
employment of at least one family member off the farm. That&#39;s a rational
individual household action.</p><p> From the community development perspective,
though, those jobs should be as close to the rural housing as possible, simply
